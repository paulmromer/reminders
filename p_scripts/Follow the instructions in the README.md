Follow the instructions in the README.md file from the repository:

The hard part of these instructions is to modify the two scripts. As they explain, to complete this assignment, you can work as a team with other students. When you have a working version of the two scripts, submit a pure text file with the names of your team members (if any) and the two new scripts you write and test.



Office Hours Weds 2-5 pm in Fulton 528

This Weds from 2-5 pm, the TAs, Grace and Domingos, will have office hours from 2-5 pm. They can help you if you are having trouble with the ssh assignment that is due on Thursday.

They can also help you this week on the big assignment due next Weds (at midnight.) I should be there next Wednesday as well but for a coding assignment, it is good to get started in advance and leave you self plenty of time. So start work on this asap and seek help if you are stuck.

No Class for Section 2 tonight, Tues Jan 29

Unfortunately, a conflict has come up and I can't be there to lecture tonight. I'm very sorry. We'll figure out how to make this up later in the term.

As you will see, there is a new assignment that asks you to download and run a corrected version of the scripts we looked at last week. These have been tested on both macOS and Windows and should work.

The assignment asks you to play with these scripts, understand what they do, then modify them to make them more useful. One good way to spend the time tonight might be to work with other members of your section on this homework assignment. You could meet face-to-face to do this work during the time when class was supposed to meet.
