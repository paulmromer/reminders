Summary
Issues: 
    - don't use bash5 - Fixed in reminders_final
    - be careful about python vs python3
        - for now, create python in /usr/local/bin
        - create a script to do this? Or instructions? 
    - bin <-> scripts
    - how to setup shebang? 
        -test PATH
    - how to zip up the folder so it unzips correctly on win?

I think that 
#!/usr/bin/env python -X utf8
will work if python is on PATH. Maybe not otherwise.
